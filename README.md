# Call_Center_Excel_Dashboard
In this mini project I used a dataset that I obtained from 'Real World Fake Data' and then built a dashboard using Excel with different charts and filters to visualize the data.

Resource

Dataset used : https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv

Features

This interactive dashboard shows multiple KPIs and is filterable by call_day,call_reason,state and channel
